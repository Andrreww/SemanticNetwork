developmental, cultural, and/or environmental problems:

• Catabolic illness
• Infection
• Sepsis

Signs/Symptoms (Defining Characteristics)

developmental, cultural, and/or environmental problems:

• Physiologic causes, e.g., improvement in patient/client status, allowing return to total or partial oral diet; changes in the course of disease resulting in
changes in nutrient requirements
• Product or knowledge deficit on the part of the caregiver or clinician
• End of life care if patient/client or family do not desire nutrition support

INTAKE DOMAIN (cid:402) Fluid Intake

Definition

INADEQUATE FLUID INTAKE (NI-3.1)

Lower intake of fluid-containing foods or substances compared to established reference standards or recommendations based upon physiological needs

Etiology (Cause/Contributing Risk Factors)

Factors gathered during the nutrition assessment process that contribute to the existence or the maintenance of pathophysiological, psychosocial, situational,
developmental, cultural, and/or environmental problems:

• Physiologic causes, e.g., increased fluid needs due to climate/temperature change; increased exercise or conditions leading to increased fluid losses; fever
causing increased insensible losses, decreased thirst sensation, use of drugs that reduce thirst
• Lack of access to fluid, e.g., economic constraints, cultural or religious practices, inability to access fluid independently (such as elderly or children)
• Food- and nutrition-related knowledge deficit
• Psychological causes, e.g., depression or disordered eating; demen tia resulting in decreased recognition of thirst

Signs/Symptoms (Defining Characteristics)

A typical cluster of subjective and objective signs and symptoms gathered during the nutrition assessment process that provide evidence that a problem exists;
quantify the problem and describe its severity.

Definition

INADEQUATE FIBER INTAKE (NI-53.5)

Lower intake of fiber-containing foods or substances compared to established reference standards or recommendations based upon physiological needs

Etiology (Cause/Contributing Risk Factors)

Factors gathered during the nutrition assessment process that contribute to the existence or the maintenance of pathophysiological, psychosocial, situational,
developmental, cultural, and/or environmental problems:

• Lack of access to fiber-containing foods
• Food- and nutrition-related knowledge deficit
• Psychological causes, e.g., depression or disordered eating
• Prolonged adherence to a low-fiber or low-residue diet
• Difficulty chewing or swallowing high-fiber foods
• Economic constraints that limit availability of appropriate foods
• Inability or unwillingness to purchase or consume fiber-containing foods
• Inappropriate food preparation practices, e.g., reliance on overprocessed, overcooked foods

Signs/Symptoms (Defining Characteristics)
